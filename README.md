Python is a great programming language for all ages and skill levels. It's ecosystem of packages extends the language to many areas of software development. This repository provides concise code examples about basic Python features as well as more advanced topics relevant to scientific computing.

## Examples

Example code is located in the `projects` and `scripts` directories. The examples are discussed on the Notes page at https://gavinw.me/notes in the Python section.

## Contributing

If you have questions or find errors in the code examples then please submit an issue. Pull requests for new code examples are not accepted because this repository is for my own personal notes. However, pull requests to fix errors in existing code are welcome.
